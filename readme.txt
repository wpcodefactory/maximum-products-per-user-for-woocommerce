== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Is it possible that the limits could work for different products at the same time instead of the same ones?
Yes, it's possible, but it's a bit of a workaround. You'll need to assign all your products to some category or tag. After that you need to enable "**Limits > Per product category**" (or "**Limits > Per product tag**"), and then set "**Limit per user**" option for that category (or tag) in "**Products > Categories > Your category > Edit**".

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
3. Start by visiting plugin settings at "WooCommerce > Settings > Maximum Products per User".
